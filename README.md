# unbaited (fork)

Control your X feed with an LLM of your choice from Groq. A browser extension that helps you filter out engagement bait and inflammatory content from your X (formerly Twitter) feed.

This is a fork of [danielpetho/unbaited](https://github.com/danielpetho/unbaited) with planned improvements.

## Planned Features

- **Thread context awareness**: Capture reply chains and analyze parent + reply together. When filtering a reply, also hide the orphaned parent tweet (and vice versa) instead of leaving contextless tweets visible.

- **Quick "Not Interested" button**: Click a button on any tweet to have an LLM analyze what it's about and automatically add that category to your filter criteria. Mimics Twitter mobile's "Not interested" feature for desktop web.

- **Reverse mode**: Toggle to only show filtered tweets. Useful for validating and tuning your prompt—scroll through what would be hidden to check for false positives.

## How it works

The extension uses Groq's ultra-fast API to analyze tweets using a model of your choice. When you scroll through X, it:

1. Detects new tweets as they appear in your viewport
2. Sends the tweet content (only text as of now) to Groq's API for analysis
3. Blurs tweets that are identified as engagement bait, political tweets, etc.
4. Gives you the option to reveal hidden tweets with a single click

## Installation

### Chrome/Safari
1. Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unbaited-prototype/bpbnggihcaknipcgbpgjgfhgmdgcokcg)
2. Get your API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com)
3. Open the extension settings and enter your API key
4. Optionally customize the system prompt to adjust how tweets are analyzed

### Firefox
1. Install the extension from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unbaited-prototype/)
2. Get your API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com) 
3. Open the extension settings and enter your API key
4. Optionally customize the system prompt to adjust how tweets are analyzed

## Browser Support

- Chrome: ✅ Full support
- Firefox: ✅ Full support
- Safari: ✅ Full support

## Development

The project consists of two parts:
- `extension/`: The Chrome extension
- `landing/`: The landing page built with Next.js

### Extension Development

```bash
cd extension
npm i
npm build
```

#### Loading in browsers

##### Chrome/Safari
Load the `extension/dist` directory as an unpacked extension:
1. Open Chrome/Safari
2. Go to Extensions page
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension/dist` directory

##### Firefox
Load the extension temporarily:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox"
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
5. Select any file in the `extension/dist` directory

### Implementation Notes

The extension uses different approaches for background processing:
- Chrome/Safari: Uses Service Workers (MV3)
- Firefox: Uses Background Scripts (MV3 with scripts fallback)

This is handled automatically in the code, but when testing make sure to verify functionality in both environments.
